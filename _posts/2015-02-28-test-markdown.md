### What?

Sawyer serves the reference needs for all Div 1 and Div 2 students, so they have a massive collection of books and very smart bookcases to support storing and displaying a selection of loanable books. These bookcases are fitted with wheels that move along tracks on the floor. When users turn the handle to the side of each bookcase, the case would move towards the direction of the turning movement.

## Why is it great?

The design works on a single valuable observation: that the aisles on either sides of each bookcase are not occupied all the time. This means that if we can eliminate these often un-used space, we could reclaim a lot of storage *affordance* for the bookcases.
